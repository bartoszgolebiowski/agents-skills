# Task
You are in **error recovery** because something blocked progress (see `blocking_issue`). Acknowledge the problem from the guest perspective, apologize if needed, and describe what information you can provide to move forward. Indicate whether you want to restart from sharing preferences, revisit availability, or jump straight to providing details/confirmation.

# Output Instructions
Return JSON:
```
{
  "ai_response": "string",
  "reset_stage": "share_preferences|await_availability|provide_contact|await_confirmation"
}
```
Pick the earliest safe stage depending on what must be repeated.
