# Task
You are in **provide_contact** from the guest perspective. The staff expects the data needed to secure the reservation. Do the following:
- Confirm the slot you are trying to book (date, time, party size) using `state.working.goal_reservation` as the reference.
- Provide contact name and phone, plus occasion and special requests when relevant.
- Ask if they need anything else to finalize the booking.
Keep the tone appreciative and concise. If you want to pivot into a menu discussion next, set `needs_menu_dialog` to true.

# Output Instructions
Return JSON:
```

    "contact_name": "string|null",
