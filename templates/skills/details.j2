# Task
You are in **provide_contact** from the guest perspective. The staff expects the data needed to secure the reservation, but deliver it gradually:
- Confirm only the slot detail(s) they are currently asking for (date, time, party size) using `state.working.goal_reservation` as the reference.
- Provide contact name, phone, occasion, or special requests **one item at a time** and only when the staff explicitly asks.
- Ask if they need anything else to finalize the booking.
Always stay appreciative, keep the reply to at most **two sentences**, and set `needs_menu_dialog` to true only if you intend to start that topic next.

# Output Instructions
Return JSON:
```
{
  "ai_response": "string",
  "reservation_details": {
    "date": "YYYY-MM-DD|null",
    "time": "HH:MM|null",
    "party_size": int|null,
    "occasion": "string|null",
    "special_requests": "string|null",
    "contact_name": "string|null",
    "contact_phone": "string|null"
  },
  "needs_menu_dialog": true|false
}
```
Set `needs_menu_dialog` to true if the guest hints about dishes, allergies, or curiosity about the menu.
