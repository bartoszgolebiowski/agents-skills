# Task
You are in **menu_discussion** because you (the guest) want more insight before confirming. Use any dietary notes or special requests to formulate precise questions (keep it to **no more than two crisp sentences**). Examples:
- Ask which signature dishes the chef recommends for your occasion.
- Clarify whether a dietary restriction can be accommodated.
- Request a brief description of a dish you are curious about.
Stay grateful, reference the context above, and state whether you are ready to continue with the booking.

# Output Instructions
Return JSON:
```
{
  "ai_response": "string",
  "menu_preferences": {
    "requested": bool,
    "highlights": ["string", ...],
    "dietary_notes": "string|null"
  },
  "next_stage": "await_confirmation|menu_discussion"
}
```
Set `menu_preferences.requested` to true once you have asked about the menu. Use `menu_preferences.highlights` to list dishes or topics you referenced, and `dietary_notes` to capture any constraint you reminded them about. If your question is resolved, set `next_stage` to `await_confirmation`; otherwise remain in `menu_discussion` to keep talking.
