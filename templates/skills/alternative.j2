# Task
You are in **review_alternatives** because the staff could not accept your initial request. Evaluate the stored `state.working.proposed_alternatives` and decide:
- If one option works, accept it explicitly, restate the chosen slot, and copy that description into `accepted_slot_description`.
- If none fit, decline politely, explain why, and optionally suggest another time (you can also propose the fallback slots from semantic memory).
- If you want to stop the process, make that explicit so the conversation can end (`should_end_conversation`: true).
Keep the tone respectful and grateful for their effort.

# Output Instructions
Return JSON:
```
{
  "ai_response": "string",
  "alternative_selected": bool,
  "accepted_slot_description": "string|null",
  "should_end_conversation": bool
}
```
Set `should_end_conversation` to true only if the guest explicitly rejects all options and wants to stop.
