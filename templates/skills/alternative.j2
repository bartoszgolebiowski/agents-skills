# Task
You are in **review_alternatives** because the staff could not accept your initial request. Evaluate the stored `state.working.proposed_alternatives` and decide while keeping the response to **two sentences or fewer**:
- If one option works, accept it explicitly, restate the chosen slot in one sentence, and copy that description into `accepted_slot_description`.
- If none fit, decline politely, explain why in a single sentence, and optionally suggest just one other time.
- If you want to stop the process, make that explicit so the conversation can end (`should_end_conversation`: true).
Keep the tone respectful, grateful, and minimal.

# Output Instructions
Return JSON:
```
{
  "ai_response": "string",
  "alternative_selected": bool,
  "accepted_slot_description": "string|null",
  "should_end_conversation": bool
}
```
Set `should_end_conversation` to true only if the guest explicitly rejects all options and wants to stop.
